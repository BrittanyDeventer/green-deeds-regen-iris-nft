# How does it work for food waste?

A user starts by sorting their acceptable food waste into compostable bags.

Then drop these bags off at the composite site of a local community garden.

The user scans the unique QR code found at the site to validate their drop off.

A community garden volunteer acts as a validator and verifies that the food being recycled into the first stage of the local compost bin is acceptable. If any flaws are detected it is removed.

Over time, as more and more user food waste is added to the community garden's compost system, as another validator operation, a community garden volunteer also is tasked with sampling both the soil of each plot that the compost is being donated for in order to ensure quality.

The soil sample quality is recorded on the Regen Network.
